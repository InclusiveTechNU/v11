**Made with :purple_heart: in Evanston, IL at the [Northwestern Inclusive Technology Lab](http://inclusive.northwestern.edu/)**

V11 is a JavaScript runtime and code editor for building accessibility plugins, workflows, and applications. It is built on top of [V8](https://v8.dev/) and works to provide a lightweight and easy to learn interface for querying and manipulating applications and accessibility APIs using the features you love from JavaScript and relieving you of cross-platform nightmares.

*If you're only interested in using V11 in a new or existing tool, just follow [these instructions]().*

The instructions here very briefly cover steps to build the V11 REPL. They assume you have typical native development tools setup for your OS, and support for [bazel](https://bazel.build/) and git. For more details of required dependencies, building V11 with different options, etc. follow these links instead:

* [Building and Running V11]() - **TODO: Insert Link**
* [Using a custom V11 build in your tool]() - **TODO: Insert Link**

**Installing Dependencies**

To get ready to build the source install the software requirements:
```shell
```

If you want to compile V8 from source and live on the bleeding edge also install:
```shell
```

**Building V11**

To build a local debug version of the V11 CLI tools the following commands should get you started on macOS/Linux:

```shell
```

You will now be in the V11 REPL and can evaluate expressions. Good luck and happy coding!
